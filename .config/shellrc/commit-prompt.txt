Task: Write a commit message based on a provided Git diff.

Rules to follow:
1. Write the commit message in present tense (e.g., "fixes" instead of "fixed").
2. The commit title (first line) should be short and fit in one line. If there are too many changes to summarize, provide a detailed explanation in the commit description (additional lines after the title).
3. The commit message should follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.).

Generate the commit message in the following format, **only**:
<commit-message-summary>
<commit-description>

Where:
- **<commit-message-summary>** is a concise, one-line summary of the change, in present tense, and following the Conventional Commits specification.
- **<commit-description>** is an optional, detailed explanation of changes. If the summary is sufficient, leave this blank.

Output **ONLY** the commit message in this format. Do **not** include anything else, such as markdown, comments, or any additional text.

You will receive the diff of staged files as input. Based on that, generate the commit message strictly following these rules.
