description: Atomic commits only — stages and commits all current changes using Conventional Commits. No push, no PR, no branch creation.

Load the `atomic-git` skill if it is not already in your context. If context compaction has occurred, reload it before continuing.

Run Workflow A: Commit only. Stage and create atomic Conventional Commits from all current changes. Do not push, do not create a branch, do not open a PR. Work on whatever branch is currently checked out, including `main`.
